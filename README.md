# Mull

Mull is a LLVM-based tool for Mutation Testing with a strong focus on C and C++
languages.

## What is Mutation Testing

Mutation Testing, a fault-based software testing technique, serves as a way to evaluate and improve quality of software tests.

> A tool for mutation testing creates many slightly modified versions of original program and then runs a test suite against each version, which is called a _mutant_. A mutant is said to be _killed_ if the test suite detects a change to the program introduced by this mutant, or _survived_ otherwise. Each mutation of original program is created based on one of the predefined rules for program modification called _mutation operators_. Each mutant is represented by a _mutation point_: a combination of mutation operator and location of a mutation in the programâ€™s source code. To assess the quality of a test suite mutation testing uses a metric called _mutation score_, or _mutation coverage_.

## Installation

You can install Mull using prebulit packages (TBD) or build it yourself from
sources as described here: [Hacking on Mull](/docs/documentation/hacking.md#local-development-setup)

## Usage

Here is an example using OpenSSL

### Prepare your project

To use Mull you need to build the project using Clang with the `-fembed-bitcode`
and debug information:

```
git clone https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git
cd openssl
./config -no-asm -no-shared -g -O0 -fembed-bitcode
make all
```

**Make sure you don't use clang from Xcode, it is not compatible with open-source
version of LLVM.**

### Run mull

Once the build is done you can run Mull against OpenSSL's tests:

```
mull-cxx -test-framework=CustomTest test/bio_enc_test
```

### Treat results

Mull works on level of LLVM Bitcode, therefore some of mutations may not be
represented at the source level - these are Junk Mutations. Mull can use debug
information to look back at the source code and decide whether a mutation is
junk or not.

For this to work you need to provide a compilation database,
compilation flags, or both.

It is not trivial to build the compilation database for the OpenSSL, but you
can pick required compilation flags by observing build logs.

```
mull-cxx -test-framework=CustomTest \
  -compilation-flags="-I . -I crypto/modes -I crypto/include -I include -I apps " \
  test/bio_enc_test
```

By default, clang adds implicit header search paths, they should be added to
the `-compilation-flags` explicitly. You can find them using the following
commands for C and C++ respectively:

```
clang -x c -c /dev/null -v
clang++ -x c++ -c /dev/null -v
```

Example output:

```
#include <...> search starts here:
 /usr/local/include
 /opt/llvm/5.0.0/lib/clang/5.0.0/include
 /usr/include
 /System/Library/Frameworks (framework directory)
 /Library/Frameworks (framework directory)
End of search list.
```

Which should be transformed into this form (you don't want to see mutations
inside of a system header files):

```
-isystem /usr/local/include -isystem /opt/llvm/5.0.0/lib/clang/5.0.0/include -isystem /usr/include
```

So the complete example will like this:

```
mull-cxx -test-framework=CustomTest \
  -compilation-flags="\
    -I . -I crypto/modes -I crypto/include -I include -I apps \
    -isystem /usr/local/include \
    -isystem /opt/llvm/5.0.0/lib/clang/5.0.0/include \
    -isystem /usr/include" \
  test/bio_enc_test
```
